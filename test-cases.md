### üîé Test Case Breakdown

```js
test("Example 1: [4,1,8,7] => true", () => {
  expect(judgePoint24([4, 1, 8, 7])).toBe(true);
});
```

‚úÖ **Explanation:**

* This is the classic example from LeetCode.
* Valid solution: **(8 - 4) \* (7 - 1) = 24**
* Confirms solver returns `true` for a solvable set.

---

```js
test("Example 2: [1,2,1,2] => false", () => {
  expect(judgePoint24([1, 2, 1, 2])).toBe(false);
});
```

‚ùå **Explanation:**

* There‚Äôs no way to reach 24 with two 1‚Äôs and two 2‚Äôs.
* Confirms solver correctly detects **unsolvable** sets.

---

```js
test("Extra: [3,3,8,8] => true", () => {
  expect(judgePoint24([3, 3, 8, 8])).toBe(true);
});
```

‚úÖ **Explanation:**

* Requires using division cleverly.
* One valid solution:
  `8 / (3 - 8/3) = 24`
* Good for testing **floating-point precision** and division handling.

---

```js
test("Extra: [7,7,3,3] => true", () => {
  expect(judgePoint24([7, 7, 3, 3])).toBe(true);
});
```

‚úÖ **Explanation:**

* Multiple solutions possible, one is:
  `(7 - 3) * (7 - 3) = 16` (not enough)
  But a valid solution is:
  `(7 * 3) + (7 + 3) = 21 + 10 = 31 ‚ùå` (not 24)
  ‚Üí Wait, let's verify this one carefully.

Actually, this is a good candidate to double-check ‚Äî because not every pair of \[7,7,3,3] combinations yield 24.

Let's quickly analyze:

* 7 + 7 = 14, 3 + 3 = 6 ‚Üí 14 + 6 = 20 ‚ùå
* 14 - 6 = 8 ‚ùå
* 14 \* 6 = 84 ‚ùå
* 14 / 6 = 2.33 ‚ùå

Another try:

* 7 - 3 = 4, other 7 - 3 = 4 ‚Üí 4 \* 4 = 16 ‚ùå
* 4 + 4 = 8 ‚ùå
* 4 / 4 = 1 ‚ùå

It seems `[7,7,3,3]` **might actually be unsolvable** ‚Äî meaning this test might **fail** with your solver.
We can run `judgePoint24([7, 7, 3, 3])` in Node to confirm.

---

```js
test("Extra: [1,1,1,1] => false", () => {
  expect(judgePoint24([1, 1, 1, 1])).toBe(false);
});
```

‚ùå **Explanation:**

* Obvious edge case ‚Äî sum of all numbers is 4, can never get to 24.

### Summary Table

| Test Case   | Expected        | Valid Solution / Reason      |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `[4,1,8,7]` | ‚úÖ true          | `(8 - 4) * (7 - 1) = 24`     |
| `[1,2,1,2]` | ‚ùå false         | No solution possible         |
| `[3,3,8,8]` | ‚úÖ true          | `8 / (3 - 8/3) = 24`         |
| `[7,7,3,3]` | ‚ùì (Needs check) | Might actually be unsolvable |
| `[1,1,1,1]` | ‚ùå false         | Cannot reach 24              |

‚úÖ Your tests are **good coverage** for:

* Basic solvable case
* Basic unsolvable case
* Floating-point division
* Duplicate numbers
* Edge case with all 1‚Äôs

‚ö†Ô∏è **Action point:** `[7,7,3,3]` may actually be unsolvable.
Would you like me to quickly run through the solution search for `[7,7,3,3]` and confirm (so we know if your test should expect `true` or `false`)?
